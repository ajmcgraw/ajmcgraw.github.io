## ABOUT

I completed my B.A. in Anthropology with a concentration in Biological Archaeology at Hamline University in May of 2012. After graduation I worked as an Archeological Technician and Field Director. During this time, I waded through swamps, and fields of poison ivy and briar in efforts to locate archaeological sites. I mapped these sites on a Trimble GPS and then later mapped them all by hand. After doing this for a couple of years, I realized that interpreting maps and making new ones was the part of the job I enjoyed the most.



I have always been interested in technology, the environment, and maps. GIS is a perfect marriage of these three interests. I am now a student at the University of Minnesota pursuing my Master of Geographic Information Science, with an expected graduation of May 2019. While here my goal is to take a wide variety of GIS classes to promote a well-rounded education and understanding of Geographic Information Science.



My professional interests include using GIS to view how humans interact with the environment, cartography, and using spatial analysis to solve a multitude of problems. In the long term, Iâ€™d like to get become a Certified GIS Professional (GISP) and eventually become a Project Management Professional (PMP).

 

At the beginning of the MGIS program we did a StrengthsFinder Exercise. Four of my top five strengths were Learner, Achiever, Ideation, and Strategic. These strengths help describe what I would to like to do with GIS: continue to learn, problem solve, and recognize patterns.
